# VillageWatch

Community safety reporting for villages and neighbourhoods. Residents report
what they see; AI strips out personal details and categorises the report; the
map and push alerts do the rest. Coordinators moderate, and pattern detection
flags clusters before anyone joins the dots by hand.

## Next.js 16 conventions — these differ from Next 14/15

These bite on every file. Get them wrong and the build fails in ways that look
unrelated.

- **`middleware.ts` is now `proxy.ts`.** It lives at `src/proxy.ts` and exports
  a function named `proxy` (or a default export). There is no `middleware.ts`
  in this repo and there should never be one.
- **`cookies()` and `headers()` are async.** Always `await cookies()`. This is
  why `createClient()` in `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` is async — never hoist
  its result to a module constant.
- **Page `params` and `searchParams` are Promises.** Type them as
  `Promise<{ id: string }>` and await them:
  ```ts
  export default async function Page({ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {
    const { id } = await params;
  }
  ```
- **Route handlers** are unchanged: `export async function POST(request: NextRequest)`.
- Before writing anything unfamiliar, read the bundled docs in
  `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` rather than trusting memory.

---

## Prisma 7 conventions

- **The connection URL lives in `prisma.config.ts`, not `schema.prisma`.** The
  `datasource db` block only declares `provider` and `extensions`.
- `prisma.config.ts` uses `DIRECT_URL` (port 5432) — migrations cannot run
  through pgBouncer. The application runtime uses `DATABASE_URL` (pooled, port
  6543) through the driver adapter in `src/lib/prisma.ts`.
- The generated client lands in `src/generated/prisma/` and is **gitignored**.
  Import from `@/generated/prisma/client`; import enums as *types* from
  `@/generated/prisma/enums` so client bundles stay clean.
- Run `npx prisma generate` after any schema change, and keep
  `postinstall: "prisma generate"` in `package.json` so Vercel never serves a
  stale client.

### PostGIS

`Incident.locationPoint`, `PatternAlert.centroidPoint` and `Village.boundary`
are `Unsupported("geography(...)")`. **Prisma Client cannot read or write
them.**

- Application code writes `lat`/`lng` only. Database triggers derive the
  geography columns — see `prisma/sql/postgis.sql`, which must be applied once
  after the first migration.
- Radius and clustering queries use `prisma.$queryRaw` with `ST_DWithin` /
  `ST_Distance`. There is a worked example at the bottom of that SQL file.
- Never add a required `Unsupported` field — Prisma Client could not create
  rows at all.

## Domain rules

These are not style preferences. Breaking them leaks residents' personal data.

1. **`Incident.rawDescription` is never public.** It holds the reporter's
   verbatim words — names, plates, addresses. Only the reporter, coordinators
   and moderators may read it, and every read writes an `AuditLog` row. The
   public surface is `Incident.description`, the anonymised rewrite.
2. **Coordinates are fuzzed before they are stored.** Jitter by
   `LOCATION_FUZZ_METERS` on the way in. The exact reported point is never
   persisted, so it cannot leak later.
3. **Media is redacted and EXIF-stripped before it is served.** Serve
   `redactedPath` once `redactedAt` is set; never serve the original upload to
   residents. Photo GPS EXIF has re-identified people before.
4. **The village is the tenant boundary.** Every incident query must be scoped
   by `villageId`. Use `getCurrentVillageId()` — never trust a village id that
   arrived in a request body.
5. **Roles come from the server.** `role` and `verifiedAt` are set by server
   code from a verified join code or a coordinator action, never from a client
   payload.
6. **Only `PUBLIC_INCIDENT_STATUSES` reach residents.** Drafts, pending and
   rejected reports stay in the moderation queue.
7. **`AuditLog` is append-only.** Never update or delete rows from application
   code.

## Auth model

- `src/proxy.ts` is an **optimistic** redirect layer — it keeps signed-out users
  out of app routes and refreshes session cookies. It is not the authorisation
  boundary.
- `src/app/(app)/layout.tsx` calls `requireSession()`. That is the real gate.
- Coordinator routes additionally call `requireCoordinator()`.
- RLS on every table is the last line of defence and is **not yet configured**
  — see Not built yet, below.
- `getSession()` uses `supabase.auth.getUser()`, which revalidates the JWT
  against Supabase. Never swap it for `getSession()` on the Supabase client,
  which trusts the cookie as-is.

---

## Deployment guardrails

- **Never push directly to `main`.** `main` auto-deploys to production.
- Feature branch → PR → Vercel preview → review → merge.
- Staging uses a separate Supabase project. Never point a preview deployment at
  the production database.
- **Never run `prisma migrate deploy` against production by hand.** Migrations
  run in the deploy pipeline against staging first.
- `prisma db push` is for local scratch databases only — it does not create
  migration history.
- After any migration that adds a geography column, re-run
  `prisma/sql/postgis.sql`.
- Never commit `.env.local`, real connection strings, or
  `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. Only `.env.example` is committed.
- The git committer email must match a GitHub account Vercel recognises, or the
  deploy is blocked.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev              # Dev server (Turbopack)
npm run build            # Production build — run before every PR
npx tsc --noEmit         # Typecheck
npx eslint .             # Lint
npx prisma generate      # Regenerate client after schema changes
npx prisma migrate dev   # Create + apply a migration locally
npx prisma studio        # Browse data
psql "$DIRECT_URL" -f prisma/sql/postgis.sql   # Apply PostGIS triggers
```

## Not built yet

Day 1 delivered the scaffold, schema and landing page. Still open:

- No Supabase project, no database, no migrations have been run.
- **Row-level security is not configured on any table.** Do this before any
  real resident data exists.
- The AI anonymisation pass, pattern detection and Web Push delivery are all
  unimplemented — `anonymized`, `aiSummary` and `pushSubscription` are columns
  waiting for code.
- `/map`, `/incidents`, `/incidents/new`, `/dashboard` and `/settings` are
  placeholders.
- `/forgot-password` is linked from the login form but does not exist yet.
- No tests, no CI, no staging environment, no auto-versioning.
- Light theme only. Add a dark palette deliberately — `prefers-color-scheme`
  would half-apply to the map and severity badges.

## Open product questions

Defaults were chosen to keep Day 1 moving. Confirm before seeding real data:

- `Village.country` defaults to `"GB"` and `Village.timezone` to
  `"Europe/London"`. The product language is British English throughout
  ("antisocial behaviour", "999"). Change all three together if the launch
  market is not the UK.
